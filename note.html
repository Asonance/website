<h1>Author's Note</h1>
<p>This story is by no means complete, I’m constantly adding chapters and editing ones I’ve written, sometimes I insert more chapters too. I’ve only got the first five chapters here so far, there are more but everything beyond this is a mess and needs fixing up. I started writing this in lockdown during 2020 but haven’t had much time to work on this since then. This story makes no sense, I’m aware… </p>

<p>When I began writing this story, I was fourteen and I had no friends. I felt alone and I felt weird for having all of these strange feelings so I tried putting it all into a story and years later, I'm still going. I felt like Valentina was my best friend because I made her to be so much like me. Writing the story took me to a fantasy world where she existed and she understood me even though no one else did. </p>
