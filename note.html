<p>This story is by no means complete, I’m constantly adding chapters and editing ones I’ve written, sometimes I insert more chapters too. I’ve only got the first five chapters here, there are more but everything beyond this is a mess and needs fixing up. I started writing this in lockdown during 2020 but haven’t had much time to work on this since then. This story makes no sense, I’m aware… </p>
