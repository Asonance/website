<h1>Chapter Three - Play Time</h1>
<p>Lyn woke up early that morning, she wasn’t completely soaked but she decided she would need to change within the hour. Lyn looked over at Valentina, admiring her pretty face. Valentina was a heavy sleeper so she knew it could be a while before she woke up. </p>

<p>Lyn tried to fall back asleep but couldn’t bring herself to. Instead, she lay awake on the floor of Valentina’s bedroom, staring at the wall beneath her desk. Eventually she couldn’t take it and threw herself onto Val’s bed. Valentina groaned and sat up in her bed. </p>

<p>“Good morning Val!” Lyn yelled excitedly. </p>

<p>Valentina rubbed her eyes and grabbed her glasses which had somehow ended up on the floor. </p>

<p>“Morning,” She yawned. </p>

<p>“How are you feeling?” </p>

<p>“Tired.” </p>

<p>There was a slight and awkward pause. </p>

<p>“You weren’t going to ask me how I was feeling…?”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>Lyn frowned. </p>

<p>“Rude...” </p>

<p>Valentina reached under her blanket to feel her diaper, it was warm but as with Lyn, didn’t need changing just yet. Lyn jumped off Valentina’s bed, and clutched onto Valentina’s arm, trying to pull her out of bed. Valentina resisted at first as she wasn’t wearing anything over her diaper, however after releasing Lyn wasn’t either, she felt okay about it. </p>

<p>Even though Valentina had stopped resisting, she didn’t exactly feel like cooperating either. When Lyn pulled her out of the bed, Val fell to the floor. </p>

<p>“Are you going to make me drag you Valentina?”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you want to be dragged down the stairs?”</p>

<p>“That’s fine. I’m just tired.”</p>

<p>Lyn dragged Val out of her room and down the stairs to the dining table. Valentina climbed onto one of the chairs. She felt especially weird having nothing between her diaper and the chair. Lyn sat down in the opposite chair.</p>
 
<p>So Val, if you had a boyfriend right, and you told them about your little secret and they said it's either them or diapers what would you choose?" Lyn asked. </p>
 
<p>"Hmmm, I think… I would choose diapers, I know that's the wrong choice especially long term and all, but I'm just way too obsessed. I can't wait to move to New York and wear diapers all by myself." </p>
 
<p>"You're moving to New York? Why?"</p>
 
<p>"University, that's why." </p>
 
<p>"Oh? What are you studying?" </p>
 
<p>"Political Science." </p>
 
<p>"That's boring, why are you studying Poli-sci?" </p>
 
<p>"Because I want to be a diplomat in some other country, also the course is only a year long." </p>
 
<p>"Even more boring. Do you even speak any foreign languages? </p>
 
<p>"Actually yes, I can speak pretty good French, and not great but enough Spanish." </p>
 
<p>"Oh right 'cause your dad’s parents were from there or something. How come you never told me you were going to New York?" </p>
 
<p>"It's not like I talk to anyone that often." </p>

<p>Lyn stayed silent. Valentina had said that with such a relaxed tone, she sounded so okay with being alone, but Lyn knew Val wasn't really okay with it. </p>

<p>“Shit, I can feel my diaper leaking again…” Lyn muttered.</p>

<p>Lyn stood up, a few droplets ran down her leg. </p>

<p>“Don’t worry, I can change you again,” Valentina offered. </p>

<p>“Yes please,” Lyn cooed. </p>

<p>They walked back up to Valentina’s room and Lyn lay on the floor. After thirty seconds Valentina had put a fresh diaper on Lyn. They decided to just stay in Valentina’s room as they were too lazy to go back downstairs. Valentina grabbed another diaper from her stash and walked to her bathroom. She decided she would have a quick shower before she would change.</p>

<p>In the end, her shower was not so quick and she left Lyn all by herself who was bored out of her mind. Lyn lay on the bedroom floor, thinking to herself. She thought about Valentina, there was something about her that Lyn really liked, maybe even loved, she just wasn't sure what it was.</p>

<p>Valentina wasn't the most sociable person and having no friends made her an easy target. People constantly teased her, bullied her and said mean things about her behind her back. Lyn thought about this and just couldn't understand what it was about Valentina they hated so much. She was such a sweet person behind her weirdness. </p>

<p>At the same time, Lyn still couldn't figure out what the strange feeling she felt around Valentina was. Was she in love with her?</p>

<p>"I'm back Lyn!" </p>

<p>Lyn was so caught up in her thoughts, she took a moment to realise Val was there. </p>

<p>"Lyn…? You awake…?" </p>

<p>"Oh, yeah, heya Val." </p>

<p>"Are you… You alright?" </p>

<p>"Yeah I'm fine." </p>

<p>"Sure?" </p>

<p>"Mhm"</p>

<p>"Well… what do you wanna do now?"</p>

<p>"Can we go outside?" </p>

<p>"Hmmm why not?" </p>

<p>Lyn lay on the floor, too tired to move. She looked up at Valentina who smiled down at her. After twenty seconds Lyn got up and started to walk out the door however Valentina stood in the way holding her arms on either side of the door frame. </p>

<p>"You really gonna head outside with just a diaper and a shirt?" Valentina asked slyly.</p>

<p>"Uhh…." </p>

<p>"It's okay, we'll just stay in the backyard, the skirt I'm wearing is a little too short, people would be able to see." </p>

<p>"Are you going to let me through the doorway, Valentina?" </p>

<p>"Nope." </p>

<p>Lyn knew she'd be able to push through Valentina since she was a foot taller but instead grabbed her, pulling her close to her body. Valentina completely froze. She felt a feeling she had never felt in her life. What was it? </p>

<p>Lyn let go of Valentina, walking out the door. Valentina remained frozen for a few seconds before following her out the door.</p>
 
<p>"Ugh my diaper is leaking again, I should get some plastic pants online or something," uttered Lyn in frustration.</p>
 
<p>"That reminds me, I still have some of my old ones from the shed, you can take a few. I have about twelve." </p>
 
<p>"Thanks, saves me some money and the chance of my dad finding out." </p>
 
<p>Lyn ran back up to Val’s room and ripped off her diaper slipping on a fresh one while Valentina waited downstairs. When Lyn came back, they went to the shed in Valentina's backyard —While only wearing shirts and diapers— and fetched some plastic pants from the shed. </p>

<p>Thanks Val, these will help,” smiled Lyn. </p>

<p>“It’s no problem.” </p>

<p>The two girls lay down on the wet grass facing each other, smiling. </p>

<p>“We have school soon…" Valentina sighed with a sad tone in her voice. While everyone says they hate school, no one could hate it more than Val. </p>

<p>"Yeah I guess we do," Lyn responded, lowering her head. </p>

<p>"Time to get bullied again…"</p>

<p>"Bullied?" Lyn asked, pretending not to know. She felt if Val found out she knew people bullied her she might get upset, she did always leave Val on her own at school, something she regretted.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I always get bullied." </p>

<p>"Really? Why?" </p>

<p>"Why do you think?" </p>

<p>Lyn remained silent. </p>

<p>"I'm a loser and everyone knows it." </p>

<p>"That's not tr-" </p>

<p>"It is! I just sit alone being, me, the weirdest girl there is." </p>

<p>"Well… I don't think there's anything wrong with that. "</p> 

<p>"Well, everyone else does."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter what they think."</p>

<p>"Well it does because they always tease me about it." </p>

<p>"Who would even do that?" </p>

<p>"My sister and her group. God, I wish I was her. We were both born at the same time yet we came out so different."</p>

<p>"Harmonia?" </p>

<p>"Yeah. I wish I could put her through the hell she's put me through. I'm so jealous of her. I'm jealous of Everyone."</p>
 
<p>"Wait, are you Jealous of me?" </p>
 
<p>"Maybe I am but not as Jealous of you as I am of my sister. There's always been sibling rivalry between us and she’s always been 'The perfect one' it's so annoying and she has a boyfriend she's top of the school ughh." </p>
 
<p>"I can tell.” </p>

<p>The girls sat and talked for hours and then those hours turned into days and before they knew it, their break was over and it was time for school again. </p>
