<h1>Chapter Four - School Time</h1>

<p>"Valentina! Harmonia! Time to wake up!" Valentina's dad yelled from downstairs. Val fell out of her bed, grabbed her glasses and snatched her dressing gown from the floor, sliding it onto her back to cover up as she only wore underwear (or diapers in some cases) to bed. </p>
 
<p>As Valentina ate her breakfast she saw her twin sister walk out of her room and slide down the smooth, wooden bannister. She always had to do that. She made herself breakfast and sat down at the table opposite Valentina and pulled her phone out of her pocket. Valentina watched her with Jealousy as she texted her boyfriend.</p> 
 
<p>"She really is better than me in every way isn’t she?” Valentina thought to herself. “We look almost exactly the same yet I’m all alone and she’s the most popular girl in school…”</p>
 
<p>"So Val, did you get up to anything while I was away?" Harmonia asked. Valentina opened her mouth to speak but didn't say anything. "Didn't think so,” Harmonia said, giving her an evil look.</p>

<p>“FUCK YOU HARMONIA!! FUCK OFF!!” Valentina stood up, holding a fork at her twin sister that she had instinctively picked up from the table. </p>

<p>“Valentina watch your mouth!!” Their mother yelled from another room.</p>
 
<p>Valentina slammed the fork back onto the table (which then slid onto the floor) and ran upstairs to grab her clothes, contemplating whether or not she should wear a diaper to school. She wanted to but her extreme paranoia was kicking in, she couldn't think without feeling constant stress. </p>

<p>She opened her desk drawer and took one of her pills to calm down. She collapsed onto her bed, wondering if she should even go to school at all but in the end, she decided to wear her long skirt and grabbed a diaper from her stash. At her school, most girls wore shorter skirts but of course by now you've learned, Valentina was never like most girls.</p>
 
<p>Valentina had a hot shower before Harmonia pounded on the door telling her to hurry up. She turned the shower off, stepped out and dried herself off. She put on her shirt, zipped up her jacket and then nervously put a diaper on. She stared at herself in the mirror wondering what she was getting herself into, then put her skirt on. </p>
 
<p>As she packed her school books into her bag, she slipped a fourteen pack of diapers in as well. She had grabbed a padlock from the shed and locked the compartment where she had kept the diapers. She then took the silver necklace she was given for her fifteenth birthday and attached the key to it.</p>
 
<p>Finally, the two sisters walked out the door. They had forty minutes until school started and it was only a fifteen-minute walk. </p>
 
<p>When Valentina arrived at school she felt the urge to wet herself and started walking towards the toilets before realising she was in a diaper. There was a large crowd of people walking through the school and Valentina was unlucky enough to find herself in the middle of it. She knew it was okay but was just too scared to wet herself around all these people.</p>

<p>She became overwhelmed by the thoughts before deciding to walk to class, if she wet herself, she wet herself. When she walked into the main school building, she felt her diaper slowly expanding, Valentina had just wet herself without thinking, something she had wanted to avoid doing. Ironically, the fear of wetting herself, made her do exactly that. </p>

<p>In class, Valentina was learning about the cold war which had always interested her but she didn't like the idea of writing a two-thousand-word essay on it in the space of only two months. As she typed at her laptop, she could feel her wet diaper resting on her body. The feeling comforted her although she knew getting used to it in class was a bad idea. </p>

<p>After class finished they had a fifteen-minute break so Val went to the toilet and changed out of her diaper putting two more on. She tossed the diaper into a bin next to the toilet then grabbed some rubbish that was in her bag and put it on top so it was mostly covered up. </p>

<p>"The only person who would notice would be someone who opens bins and has staring contests with them," Valentina thought to herself. </p>

<p>After she had left the toilets she went to the library and searched for books which would help for her history essay. She found a book about the cold war on one of the shelves but then the bell rang for class. She snatched the book from the shelf and took it without scanning it off at the front desk.</p>
 
<p>She just made it to class on time and the teacher told them to get their books out for reading. After twenty minutes or so they put their books down and started explaining their school project.</p>
 
<p>"Ok class, you will have to write a two thousand word essay on your book. It will be due in two months right before exam time." </p>
 
<p>"Yes!" Valentina thought to herself. "Now I can kill two birds with one stone and submit the same essay for English and history!" </p>
 
<p>She knew it might be a little risky doing this but it wasn’t like teachers compared work across subjects. Plus she would slightly change the wording to make sure everything would fit. They were given the rest of the lesson to work on their essay so Valentina was pretty happy. However, she could feel the urge to go and she knew her diaper was about to leak. Just then the bell rang and Valentina raced out of the classroom. </p>
 
<p>"Saved by the bell, huh?" Val said to herself. She ran down the hall quickly while trying to grab her water bottle. She made it to the toilet and ripped off her diapers and put two more on for good measure. She had brought a fourteen pack of diapers and had only used five so she knew she could make it for the rest of the school day but at the cost of diapers, she knew she couldn't afford to burn fifteen dollars a day on diapers.</p> 
 
<p>She couldn't walk as well with the number of diapers she was wearing but she knew it wouldn't be noticeable enough for people to think anything of it. People didn't notice Valentina much anyway.</p>

<p>She sat down under a tree and pulled her phone out, scrolling through reddit, looking at nothing in particular. After a few minutes, she slid her phone back into the pocket of her jacket. She looked up to see a familiar figure standing in front of her, a small crowd behind her. </p>

<p>"What do you want, Harmonia?" Valentina asked angrily. </p>

<p>"Oh, I just came to see how my little sister was going," Harmonia answered. </p>

<p>"Okay, fuck off." </p>

<p>Harmonia kicked the ground, sending dirt all over Valentina. </p>

<p>"You're such a baby," Harmonia said, turning around and walking off. </p>

<p>"That part is true," Valentina thought to herself, grinning. </p>

<p>Valentina stood up and dusted herself off with a large amount of dirt in her mouth, through her hair and on her glasses. Almost every day people bullied Valentina and many of those same people would always ask her out. Valentina and Harmonia were both considered the prettiest girls in school, the only way to tell the difference between them being that Valentina wore glasses. </p>

<p>Of all the bullies, Harmonia was the worst. Valentina didn't care about anyone else, they would tease her with random lies and rumours. Harmonia on the other hand was always brutally honest. </p>

<p>The bell rang and Valentina ran off to her next class. She wasn't in the mood to pay attention so she sat up the back and drew in her book. After school had finished, Valentina walked back to the toilets to get changed. When she arrived, the whole place was eerily empty. </p>

<p>She went to the last cubicle and locked herself inside. She pulled her skirt down and pulled off the diaper that had clung to her body for the last few hours. She then grabbed the last diaper from her bag and unfolded it.</p>

<p>She placed the back of the diaper on the wall behind her and leaned into it, pulling the rest of it toward her body. She put the tapes together and rubbed the diaper to straighten it out. </p>

<p>She grabbed her bag and left the toilets, running through the empty school yard and out of the gates. Since Valentina was a small thin girl who never went outside, she was almost instantly out of breath, feeling a piercing pain in her abdomen for the remainder of her walk back home. </p>

<p>On arriving home, she went up to her room and changed into the second last diaper she had before going to sleep until it was time for dinner. After she was finished eating she went to her room and played video games on her computer and then wrote in her diary. </p>

<p>18 September 2020 </p>
<p>Today I started school again and it was the first time I wore a diaper there. It kinda felt weird and terrifying but also exhilarating. I’m going to try wearing them more often.  I'm not sure it will be good if I lose control of my bladder but if it happens then I'm just going to be a baby forever.</p>
