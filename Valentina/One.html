<h1>Chapter One - After all this time</h1>
<p>The sound of Valentina's heartbeat slowly grew more intense as she inched further and further away from her house. She had spent weeks planning this out but she was horrified that something would go wrong. </p>

<p>Valentina continued walking through the quiet town. As soon as she started seeing people walking about, she freaked out. Her biggest fear was people. Any normal person might run away if they saw a wild animal and felt threatened, Valentina was the same with other people. </p>

<p>She noticed a nearby bench, walked over to it, took a seat and grabbed her phone out. Valentina's goal was to make it to the supermarket, a scary thing for her to do with so many people around. There weren't too many people out as it was Sunday afternoon which made Valentina feel relieved. </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Valentina walked through the front door of the supermarket and grabbed a basket. As she wandered around, she took anything that looked like it had sugar in it and threw it in. As she succumbed to her thoughts she mindlessly walked through the supermarket. As Valentina regained consciousness she found herself in the aisle where all the health products were. As she oriented herself, something jumped out at the corner of her eye, diapers. This was what she had come here for in the first place. For as long as she could remember she fantasised about wearing them, not having to think about anything else in the world.</p> 

<p>She looked around to make sure no one was there. The supermarket was quite empty so of course, she was the only one in the aisle. </p>

<p>Valentina grabbed a bag off the shelf and held it in her hands. A mad rush of excitement pulsed through her body. As she rubbed her fingers along the packet, she could feel each individual diaper sitting underneath. She counted fourteen of them. She put it in her basket and grabbed another packet off the shelf as well. </p>

<p>The diapers were meant to fit younger teens but even though Valentina was seventeen, she had the body of a fourteen year old. She went to the self checkout and scanned all of her items then she taped her credit card onto the machine and started walking back to her House. </p>

<p>She felt excited to finally wear a diaper again after three long years of longing to. Valentina walked back to her house as fast as she could, which wasn't incredibly fast considering her short legs and the bag full of groceries she was carrying. </p>

<p>Twenty minutes later she had finally arrived home. She placed the bag of groceries on the kitchen bench and put all of the food away. At the bottom of the bag lay the two packets of diapers. Valentina took the diapers and carried them upstairs to her room.</p>

<p>She ripped one of the bags open and let all the diapers spill out onto her bed. She looked down with awe as she grabbed a diaper off the bed. She placed the diaper on the desk and took off her skirt and underwear. She placed her hands on the diaper and unfolded it, enjoying every second of it. </p>

<p>She slid it in between her legs and slowly pulled it towards her body. As it made contact, Valentina fell onto her bed, she felt an even bigger rush of excitement. She quickly taped up the diaper and then lay on her stomach. She rubbed her diaper against her bed for a few seconds before standing up again. </p>

<p>She contemplated whether or not to put her skirt back on but decided she wanted to embrace wearing a diaper.She still left her jacket on, however, Valentina always felt more secure when she was wearing a jacket and liked to keep it on, even when it was hot. Today she had learned she felt the same way about diapers. </p>

<p>She made her way downstairs to consume some of the food she had bought and watch some TV. Wearing a diaper in the middle of the living room felt exciting even though she would normally feel anxious about this kind of thing.</p>

<p>She drank sugary drinks trying to fill her bladder up as much as possible. She felt the urge to go but she held it in. Eventually she couldn't hold it in any longer and let it all out. The feeling of not having to get up when she needed to was freeing. She couldn't wait to try it while in bed. The diaper she was wearing was wet and squishy, another feeling Valentina had forgotten. </p>

<p>Valentina fell asleep on her sofa, waking up at eleven that night. She felt hungry and decided to get off the sofa and find some food. As she stood up, she could feel the weight of the diaper. When she walked to the kitchen the diaper restricted her movement. She took a plastic bag from the drawer and placed her hands on her diaper, carefully undoing the tapes. took the diaper off, placing it in the bag. </p>

<p>While naked waist down, Valentina opened her fridge looking for something to drink. She saw a bottle of beer and without thinking, grabbed it. She opened the bottle taking a few sips then walked out to her bin in her front yard and placed the plastic bag in. </p>

<p>It was only when she went back inside, she realised she had gone outside wearing nothing underneath. She felt stressed out wondering if anyone saw her but eventually released it was too late and too dark for anyone to notice. She took a few more sips of beer then walked up the stairs into her bedroom. </p>

<p>Valentina fell onto her bed and grabbed one of the diapers sitting there and unfolded it. She pulled the diaper up to her body and taped it up then put the diapers lying on her bed into the filing cabinet under her desk. It was the only secure place for them as she was able to lock the filing cabinet up. </p>

<p>She took off her glasses and threw them into the drawer next to her bed where a few diapers were already sitting, then climbed under the bed sheets and put her arms around the teddy bear she always slept with. Valentina would always worry about things as she lay in bed which would keep her up but this night was different. She just thought about diapers and felt happy to wear them. </p>

<p>Every few minutes she would sip the beer which she had placed next to her bed. Eventually she felt a little drunk and learned she didn't have control of her bladder when drunk. Valentina felt a warm feeling as her diaper filled up. She was really excited to fall asleep like this. She fell asleep with a smile on her face and continued smiling in her dreams. </p>

<p>She woke up late the next morning feeling nice and relaxed before realising she had a raging headache. Valentina reached down to her diaper and pushed the front down softly, it was soaked. She enjoyed the feeling of pushing the wet diaper towards herself and continued doing it. </p>

<p>When she got out of bed, rather than changing out of her diaper, Valentina decided to slip another diaper on top. As she made her way down stairs, she learned how fun it is to slide down the railing with a wet diaper. She wanted to do it again but didn't feel like walking back upstairs. </p>

<p>She turned on the TV then started making breakfast. Like always, there was nothing interesting on so Valentina started watching the news. As she ate her breakfast, lewd thoughts started entering her head.</p>

<p>She waited for the news to finish before putting her bowl in the sink. Valentina went to her room and took her shirt off, neatly placing it down. She remembered the diapers she placed in her cabinet and took them out, laying them on her bed. </p>

<p>Valentina decided rather than just placing packets of diapers in her cabinet every time she bought them she would take them out of their packet and put them in a box instead. She ran down the hall sliding down the railing, walking out the backdoor to the shed. She found a wooden box about one foot long and bought it back upstairs. </p>

<p>She arranged the diapers tidily in the box, leaving one out, then put the lid on as tight as she could. Valentina ripped the tape off the two diapers she was wearing, the inside one being completely soaked although nothing compared to what was about to come... </p>
