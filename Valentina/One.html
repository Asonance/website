<h1>Chapter I: After all this time/h1>

 <h3>January 15, 2023</h3>
 <h3>Valentina Secord</h3>

<p>The sound of my heart beating slowly grows more intense as I inch further and further away from my house. I had spent weeks planning this out but yet… I feel horrified that something would go wrong. I know it will. </p>

<p>I continue walking through the quiet town and as soon as I start seeing people walking about, I freak out. I don’t like admitting this but, my biggest fear is people. It always has been and I think it always will. Any normal person might run for their life if they saw a wild animal and felt threatened, for me it's the same with other people. </p>

<p>Noticing a nearby bench, I walk over to it, taking a seat and grabbing my phone out. My goal is to make it to the supermarket, a scary thing for me to do with so many people around. There aren't too many people out as it's Sunday afternoon which gives me a sense of relief. </p>

<h2><center>***</center></h2>

<p>Walking through the front entrance of the supermarket I grab a basket and wander around, I take anything that looks like it has sugar in it and throw it in. I just can't help myself. Will I die from a heart attack one day? Probably. Although I do walk around a lot. I like walking around town to just… Clear my head.</p>

<p>As I succumb to my thoughts I mindlessly walk through the supermarket. When I regain consciousness I find myself in the aisle where all the health products are. As I orient myself, something jumps out at the corner of my eye, diapers. This was what I had come here for in the first place. For as long as I could remember I fantasised about wearing them, not having to think about anything else in the world. I wanted them so bad, it had been so long but… I just hadn't found the chance to get my hands on some, until now that is. </p>

<p>I look around to make sure no one is here. The supermarket is basically empty so of course, I am the only one in the aisle, no one is going to see. </p>

<p>My hands slowly move toward a bag on the shelf, grabbing it and holding it in my hands, a mad rush of excitement pulsing through my body. As I rub my fingers along the packet, I can feel each individual diaper sitting underneath. I place it in the basket and grab another packet off the shelf as well. </p>

<p>The diapers are meant to fit younger teens but even though I'm sixteen, I seem to have the body of a twelve year old, I'm just so short and skinny. I go to the self checkout and scan all of the items I have, then tap my credit card onto the machine, walking back to my house. </p>

<p>I feel excited to finally wear a diaper again after three long years of longing to. I walk back to my house as fast as I can, which isn't incredibly fast considering my short legs, weak body and the bag full of groceries I'm lugging around.</p>

<h2><center>***</center></h2>

<p>Twenty minutes later I finally arrive home. I place the bag of groceries on the kitchen bench and sort all of the food into the cupboards. At the bottom of the bag lay the two packets of diapers. I take the diapers and carry them upstairs to my room.</p>

<p>Ripping one of the bags open, I let all the diapers spill out onto my bed. I look down with awe as I grab a diaper off the bed. Placing the diaper on the desk I take off my skirt and underwear. I place my hands on the diaper and unfold it, enjoying every second of it. </p>

<p>I slide it in between my legs and slowly pull it toward my body. As it makes contact, I fall onto my bed and feel an even bigger rush of excitement. I quickly tape up the diaper and then lay on my stomach. I rub my diaper against my bed, starting out slowly but getting more intense, the tingling sensation feeling like heaven. As I rub my body against the bed I slide my hand into my diaper and rub my clitoris. I want to stop and do something else but at the same time I'm just too mesmerised. </p>

<p>I reach down for my skirt before deciding not to put it back on. Instead, I want to embrace wearing a diaper. I still leave my jacket on, for some reason I always feel more secure when I'm wearing a jacket and like to keep it on, even when it's hot. On this particular day, I had learned I felt the same way about diapers. </p>

<p>I make my way downstairs to consume some of the food I had bought and watch some TV. Wearing a diaper in the middle of the living room feels exciting even though I would normally feel anxious about this kind of thing. I don't care anymore, it just felt so right. </p>

<p>I drink sugary drinks trying to fill my bladder up as much as possible. The urge to go surrounds my body but I somehow manage to hold it in. I can’t hold it in any longer and let it all out. The feeling of not having to get up when I need to is so freeing, I know, this is an odd thing to say. I can’t wait to try it while in bed. The diaper I'm wearing is wet and squishy, another feeling I had forgotten. </p>

<p>Feeling relaxed, I fall asleep on my sofa and when I wake up, I really feel like a baby again. I rub my eyes and check the time, eleven thirty. I feel hungry and decide to get off the sofa and find some food. Standing up, I can feel the weight of the diaper beneath me and as I walk into the kitchen, the diaper restricts my movement. I take a plastic bag from the drawer and open it up, placing it on the ground beneath me. I take my diaper off and let it fall into the bag.</p>

<p>While naked waist down, I open the fridge looking for something to drink. I grab my favourite drink, raspberry juice and then walk out to the bin in the front yard and place the plastic bag in. </p>

<p>I walk back inside realising something. I walked outside naked waist down. I'm such an idiot. Somehow I managed to do that. Stress fills my body as I begin to panic. Surely no one noticed right? It's dark and late after all. Taking a few sips of the raspberry juice I left on the counter, I walk upstairs to my bedroom.</p>

<p>I feel so exhausted and I can barely stand, I kinda feel as if the room around me is shaking a little. Must be from all the stress. Exhausted, I fall onto my bed and grab one of the diapers sitting there and unfold it. I pull the diaper up to my body and tape it up, putting the diapers lying on my bed into the filing cabinet under the desk. It's the only secure place for them as it has a lock. No one can find them, at least I hope not. It wasn't an expensive cabinet by any means so I'm sure it's not hard to pick the lock but it's not like that would happen. </p>

<p>I take off my glasses and throw them into the drawer next to my bed where a few diapers are already sitting, then I climb under the bed sheets and put my arms around the teddy bear I always sleep with. Yes… I still sleep with a teddy bear despite being sixteen. I guess you could say I'm <i>that</i> kind of girl. You've probably figured by now that I have no friends. I can't sleep without my teddy, I suck my thumb and now I'm wearing a diaper. </p>

<p>Normally I always worry about things as I lay in bed, preventing me from sleeping but tonight night feels different. I just can't stop thinking about diapers and how I'm happy to wear them. </p>

<p>As I start falling asleep, I continue to sip the raspberry juice sitting next to my bed. I'm not sure how much I've drunk this evening but it's a lot. I begin to lose control of my bladder and my body is surrounded by the warm feeling of filling a diaper up. I can't wait to fall asleep while it's wet. </p>

<h2><center>***</center></h2>
<p>"Valentina!" </p>

<p>I hear a girl's voice calling my name but all I see is white.  </p>

<p>"Where are you my baby girl?" </p>

<p>Her voice is soft and calming and it sends tingles down my spine. </p>

<p>"There you are baby!" </p>

<p>I feel her kiss me and pick me up but I still can't see her. </p>

<p>"Did you wet your diaper Valentina?" She giggles and I feel her hand press down onto my diaper. "That's okay, mummy wet her diaper too.  Do you need me to change your diaper? I think I need you to change mine."</p>

<p>She kisses me again. </p>

 <p>"You're such a cute wittel baby. <i>My</i> wittel baby. All mine."</p>

<h2><center>***</center></h2>

<p>I wake up late the next morning not feeling the least bit tired. The dream I just had… It reminds me of how lonely I am. I want someone to be my mummy like in the dream but… I guess I'll never get that. </p>

<p>I reach down to my diaper and push the front down softly, it's soaked. I really enjoy the feeling of pushing the diaper toward me and continue to do it, getting a little carried away. </p>

<p>I don't feel like changing my diaper, I like the feeling of this one but I'm also about to leak. Rather than changing, I slip another one on top. It's a tight fit and it's hard to walk but it feels good. I slide down the bannister on my way down the stairs, the feeling of it squishing my diaper feels so good that I almost want to climb back up the stairs and do it again. </p>

<p>I turn on the TV then started making breakfast. Like always, there's  nothing interesting on so I just turn on the news. As I eat my breakfast, lewd thoughts start entering her head.I wait for the news to finish before putting my bowl in the sink. I go to my room and take my shirt off, neatly placing it down. I just remembered, I still have another packet of diapers placed in my cabinet. I take them out, laying them on my bed.</p>

<p>Rather than just placing packets of diapers in my cabinet every time I buy them, I think I'll find a box to put them in. I run out to the shed, once again sliding down the bannister on my diaper and walk out the back door. I walk into my shed, walking around for a few minutes before finding a wooden box about eight inches long that looks perfect. </p>

<p>I take the box back upstairs and place it on my desk, arranging all the diapers I have tidily in the box. I pull one out and put the lid onto the box. The diapers I'm wearing are so soaked, especially the one on the inside. I rip them off and put the fresh one onto my body. </p>

<p>Playing around in diapers is certainly the most fun thing I've ever done but I wish I had someone to do it with.</p>

<h2><center>***</center></h2>
<p>The sun penetrates through my window, waking me up. My first urge, even before grabbing my glasses, is to change myself. I open my box and pull out the diaper. I have none left. I need to get more. I don't know why but I feel insecure not having any left.</p>

<p>After changing myself, I open my phone to check the time, January 18 09:52, the store should open at ten. I get dressed and run out the door. I'm yet to wear away from my house and so I feel really anxious about it. I don't know what could happen. I'm so fucked. </p>
