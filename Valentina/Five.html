<h1>Chapter Five - Alone with Myself</h1>
<p>Friends. Those whom we find to be favourable and, likewise, find us to be favourable (or at least they seem to find us favourable). Those whom we form strong bonds with. Those whom we put our trust and faith in. Those who give us support and we ourselves support in return. All of these; concepts not understood by Valentina. </p>

<p>Why would I trust someone? Why would I want to form a strong bond with someone? Who would ever find me favourable? These were thoughts she had regularly.</p>

<p>The closest she had to a friend was Lyn. It wasn't like they weren't friends but they weren't close. They had one class together for two periods a week and didn't have much to do with each other outside of it. Valentina had hoped things would change since they had discovered each other's secrets but unfortunately, that status quo remained. </p>
 
<p>Valentina woke up early on this particular morning so she crawled out of bed and made some breakfast. While she ate breakfast at her computer she did some homework and watched some anime just as she would any other morning.</p>

<p>After she had finished eating breakfast, she opened her closet, grabbing a shirt, jacket, skirt and diaper. Valentina stuffed the diaper into her jacket so no one could see it and walked to the bathroom. She placed the clothes on the bathroom counter then took off what she was currently wearing. She found a plastic bag in one of the cupboards and placed the diaper she had previously been wearing in it to dispose of later. </p>

<p>Valentina was still tired so when she placed her hands on the taps of the shower she felt weak and unable to move. Her eyes would force themselves shut and she felt as if she was about to collapse. She leaned her head on her towel which hung over the shower, attempting to get a little more rest whilst cleaning herself. </p>

<p>After trying a few times she turned the shower on and adjusted the temperature to be nice and warm. As the warm water trickled over her, Valentina began to wake up. She started thinking about everything that was going on and how different things felt. She knew it was stupid but Valentina really felt as if diapers were changing her life. It was as if she was safer, happier. </p>

<p>Eventually it was time to stop thinking about life in the shower and start thinking about going to school. Valentina hurried to get ready and ran out the door. Since Val was wearing the last diaper she had, she needed to buy more on the way to school. Luckily for her, she passed by the store every morning on her way there. </p>

<p>When she arrived at the supermarket, it was almost empty save for a few people quickly buying things before work. Valentina walked straight to the second last aisle of the store where all of the diapers were kept. They had all different kinds for all different ages and at different price ranges. Half of the aisle was just diapers so Valentina felt euphoria being surrounded by them. </p>

<p>The ones Val really wanted to buy were the big bags with forty diapers in them, each one with the most amazing soft feel over your skin, thick and fluffy padding and the perfect fit but of course they were expensive and the giant bags weren't the least bit discreet. </p>

<p>Instead she grabbed a seven pack of diapers for around ten dollars. Valentina walked over to the checkout, scanned the diapers on the machine, paid and ran out the door, trying to shove the diapers into her bag as she ran across the carpark, although it didn't seem to want to go in. She stopped running and put her bag on the ground, taking things out to shove the diapers in. She looked around worried she might see someone she knew but the streets were empty. </p>

<p>Once again, she felt ashamed about liking diapers. Not to do with actually wearing the diapers themselves but the fact she was willing to spend all of her money on it. Walking to school, she continued to reflect on this, wondering what she had gotten herself into and if there was any turning back. </p>

<p>School that day was uneventful, as with all other days. After school, Valentina decided to go via the town park and sit there for a while to relax. The park was situated on a large river that flowed through Fralda, dividing the town in two. West of the river was mostly houses with a few stores here and there, the east side was filled with shops, restaurants, offices and big roads, although surrounding all of that were even more houses. </p>

<p>Fralda wasn't a huge town, containing only nine thousand people, however it was the seat of Kouchet County. </p>

<p>Valentina had found a bench that sat in a secluded spot surrounded by trees just above the river. </p>

<p>"Perfect, no one can see me." </p>

<p>Valentina sat there for hours watching the river flow by and thinking to herself. She changed her diaper just after school finished and arrived at her spot ten minutes later. After hours of sitting there, she was completely soaked and it was time to head home. </p>

<p>She felt something slowly dripping down her legs which started to drip faster. She had wet her already full diaper, soaking her skirt as well. </p>

<p>"I told myself I wouldn't lose control like this. I should stop wearing diapers shouldn't I? I can't turn back, it's far too late."</p>

<p>In her bag she had her uniform for PE class, a subject she always skipped but still carried around the uniform for anyway. Valentina would always stay on the sideline in her normal clothes. </p>

<p>She realised that she could change into her PE pants and a new diaper so she opened her bag, pulling out another diaper from its packet and her neatly folded pair of pants. She placed the pants on the bench and the diaper on top, then unzipped her soaked skirt and untaped her diaper, shoving them quickly to the ground. </p>

<p>As fast as she could, she grabbed the diaper from the bench and put it on. Every time she put a diaper on, she did it slowly and enjoyed the moment. This time she had put a diaper on faster than she ever had before. </p>

<p>Sometimes when you change into a fresh diaper, it feels better than other times, like getting into fresh bed sheets after washing them. This was one of those times. As much as Valentina wanted to enjoy the feeling herself, she was a seventeen year old girl standing in a public area in nothing but a shirt and diaper. While the area was secluded and the odds of someone seeing her were low she still rushed to put her pants on. With pants, it was harder to hide the diaper than with skirts and there was a bulge, not noticeable from far away but still embarrassing nonetheless. Luckily her jacket was just long enough to cover it up.</p>   

<p>She wasn't sure how she would dispose of the diaper, the closest bin was on the park's main path where all the people were. In the end she realised she would have to shove it into her wet skirt and throw it away too. Valentina grabbed her stuff and began walking towards the path. Once there, she found a bin where she would have to get rid of her favourite skirt. </p>

<p>After putting everything in, she decided to walk to the store and buy some new skirts, ones that would help hide her diapers better. It was starting to get dark but since it was Friday night all of the shops were open later. </p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, Valentina found herself in a clothes store buying all sorts of skirts, dresses and jackets. The store also sold nice bags and since Valentina wouldn't be able to fit the clothes she had bought into her current bag, she had to buy one of those as well. By the time she left the store, she had almost spent her entire savings. </p>

<p>She walked a few blocks down the street where she passed a public toilet and decided to change into one of her new dresses. The dress she chose had a conservative torso with long sleeves and a skirt that went down to her knees, lined off with a flounce.</p>

<p>As she continued walking back home, she felt as if she was going out to dinner and part of her wanted to believe that she was, even though she knew that was never going to happen. </p>

<p>Valentina was worried her parents would be mad since she had arrived home so late however when she arrived at her house, her parents were nowhere to be seen. She ran upstairs and threw her bags onto her bed. Valentina grabbed the diapers out of her bag ready to put them into her closet, only to realise she had three diapers left. </p>

<p>"Looks like I'm going to have to buy some more diapers," she thought as she packed her things away. "Well, it looks like Mum and Dad are out anyway so I guess I'll go now."</p>

<p>Valentina didn't need to change as somehow she had been completely dry for over an hour. She grabbed a small bag from her dresser where she placed her last remaining diapers then set off for the store. </p>

<p>As she walked down one of the busier roads, she saw a group of people her age on the other side of the road, walking in the same direction. Valentina felt embarrassed and tried to walk a little faster. A girl from the group left them and ran across the road toward Valentina who kept her head down trying to avoid eye contact. </p>

<p>"Hey… Val…" The girl said awkwardly. Valentina paused for a second, completely stunned before she realised who it was. </p>

<p>"Uhm, hello Lyn", Valentina responded. </p>

<p>"Wanna come hang out with my friends and I…?" </p>

<p>"I don't know Lyn." </p>

<p>"Awwwww… It'll be fun." </p>

<p>"I don't think they'd like me being there." </p>

<p>"I already asked them, they said it's cool."</p>

<p>"I'm still too nervous." </p>

<p>Lyn walked right up to Valentina, leaving two inches of space between them. Lyn made direct eye contact with her. Valentina blushed, unsure of how to react or what to do. Lynx clutched onto her hand and dragged her back to her back across the street to her friends. </p>

<p>"By the way, nice dress Val." </p>

<p>Valentina still said nothing and was in complete shock. Her heart started beating as she braced herself for the awkwardness awaiting her. </p>
