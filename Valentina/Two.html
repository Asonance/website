<h1>Chapter Two - It's not just me?</h1>
<p>It only took three days for Valentina to run out of Diapers. After waking up wet one morning she went to get changed only to find one diaper in the box. She slipped it on and decided to run straight to the supermarket.</p>

<p>She was yet to wear one away from her house so she was scared of doing that, however how safe they made her feel cancelled that out. Valentina put her clothes on then raced down the stairs, almost running out the front door without putting shoes on.</p>

<p>She made it to the supermarket and lingered around the front worried someone would see her. She wanted to go in but fear was taking over. She soon calmed down, she checked to make sure no one from her school was there. Valentina made it to the diaper aisle and grabbed five packs of different diaper brands and chucked them in her basket. </p>
 
<p>"Boo!" </p>
 
<p>"Ahhh!"</p>

<p>It was Valentina’s friend Lyn. If you could call her a friend. Valentina didn't exactly go out of her way to talk to Lyn although she did like her. Lyn would often try to talk to Valentina and was one of the only people in the school who could say she could have a full conversation with Valentina. </p>

<p>"Shit," Valentina thought, "How the fuck am I going to get out of this?"  </p>

<p>Lyn's eyes locked on the pack of diapers Valentina was holding, causing Valentina to panic and her face to turn red</p>
 
<p>"I was actually here for the same thing myself," Lyn said.</p>
 
<p>"Really?" Valentina asked with complete shock.</p>
 
<p>"Yeah, I… Uh… I like wearing them..." </p>
 
<p>"In that case, come to my place."</p>
 
<p>“Hmmmmm, alright then.”</p>
 
<p>They went to the self check out and paid for them. In total between them, they had about 150 diapers and it had cost them nearly $100. Valentina only lived a few blocks away from the supermarket so they decided to run there before anyone noticed what they had. They didn’t say a word to each other on the way. A few minutes later they made it to Valentina's house.</p>

<p>“So are you a TBDL too…?” Lyn asked. </p>
 
<p>“Yeah I am,” Valentina responded.</p>
 
<p>“I mean who knew all this time.”</p>
 
<p>“Yeah. So how often do you wear them?” </p>
 
<p>“Every weekend.”</p>
 
<p>“Man, I wish I could wear them that much.”</p>
 
<p>“My dad just leaves me alone and my mum lives in another state.”</p>
 
<p>“Does your dad know?” </p>
 
<p>“He almost found my stash when he was going through my wardrobe getting rid of all the shit I have in there but I quickly grabbed the box and threw it under my bed before he noticed. What about your parents?”</p>
 
<p>"God no! They would think I'm such a weirdo."</p>
 
<p>The girls went up to Valentina's bedroom and put on the diapers. They were in heaven. Valentina offered to Lyn to let her stay until her parents came back, Lyn accepted the offer. </p>

<p>“So do you want to play some video games, Lyn?” Valentina asked. </p>
 
<p>“Sure.” </p>
 
<p>“What do you want to play?” </p>
 
<p>“I dunno.” </p>
 
<p>After spending forever browsing through Valentina's Infinite amount of video games on her Xbox, they started playing and drinking cola until their diapers were full. Lyn changed her diaper and put it into the little bag they had chucked all of their cola cans into while Valentina just kept slipping more and more on top. They lost track of time and played until about 8 pm. </p>
 
<p>“Hey, do you wanna have something to eat?” Valentina asked Lyn. </p>
 
<p>“Pizza?”</p>
 
<p>“Ok,” Valentina agreed, "But first I have to change out of the six diapers I'm wearing."</p>
<p>Both girls laughed and they went to get changed just then the phone started ringing. Valentina picked up the phone. </p>
 
<p>"Hello?" </p>
 
<p>"Hi, Val it's Mum.”</p>
 
<p>"Oh, Uh, hi, Mum, how was your day?" </p>
  
<p>"It's been fine. Have you had dinner?" </p>
 
<p>"Uhmmm…  Yes. Yes I have…”</p>
 
<p>"Ok then, I'll put daddy on for you.”</p>
 
<p>"All right bye Mummy.” </p>
 
<p>"Bye-bye." </p>
 
<p>"Hey Val.” said Valentina's father </p>
 
<p>"Hi, Daddy.”</p>
 
<p>"Are you doing ok?" </p>
 
<p>"Yeah.”</p>
 
<p>"Ok, uh, that's good then, Uh bye sweetheart." </p>
 
<p>"Bye, daddy." Valentina hung up her phone and put it on the table. "That felt awkward talking to them while wearing six diapers," Valentina told Lyn. </p>
 
<p>"Once my dad spent a week away, doing business in LA so I stayed home from school pretending to be sick and he called me one night while I was in the middle of changing and I had started taking off one tape so I had to completely change while on the phone with him and it was fucking awkward.”</p>
 
<p>Valentina went upstairs to change the heavy six diapers weighing her down. She slipped on two new diapers then put on a long skirt that went past her knees and put it on. </p>
 
<p>“Val!? What’s taking you so long!?” Lyn yelled from downstairs. </p>
 
<p>“I’m coming, be patient!” She yelled back. Valentina picked her bag up, grabbed a couple of diapers, shoved them in and ran down the stairs. </p>
 
<p>"Lyn, why can't we just order it, I mean I'm scared."</p>
 
<p>"Because I haven't worn in public before and I want to try it out.”</p>
 
<p>"I don't know, I mean I haven't either, I'm just super worried.”</p>
 
<p>"Stop worrying about it Val, nothing's gonna go bad, Kay?" </p>
 
<p>"Okay then. Can you see my diaper through my skirt Lyn?" </p>
 
<p>"Maybe get a long jacket that covers it and you will be fine."</p>
 
<p>The girls grabbed their stuff and started walking out the door when Valentina ran back inside and grabbed four diapers and shoved them in her bag. As they walked outside, Valentina constantly looked around for other people, even though no one was there. </p>
 
<p>"So Lyn, when did you know for certain you were a diaper lover?" Valentina asked. </p>
 
<p>"I think I always have. My parents were in an abusive relationship ever since I can remember and when I was younger I would cry all the time and wish I was an ignorant child, so diapers were a coping mechanism for me. What about you?" </p>
 
<p>"Look you probably know why, I have anxiety so I'm always paranoid and insecure and I was always a bed wetter which is why I never went to school camp.”</p>
 
<p>"You said you were going to grandma's birthday and it was always in the week we went to camp!" </p>
 
<p>"Yeah, I lied, anyway, after my parents decided I didn't need diapers anymore I had to steal them from my sister.”</p>
 
<p>"Wait so bedwetting runs in the Family?"</p>
 
<p>"Apparently. So we had a storeroom where we kept all the diapers so there would always be literally hundreds of diapers so no one would notice if one was missing. And my sister and parents being out on Saturday nights helped too. When everyone was gone I would play around in diapers.”</p>
 
<p>"Ok, well it looks like we're here." </p>

<p>The girls went in and ordered around six pizzas and lots of drinks. It took forever for them to make the order so while they were waiting the drunk heaps. Lyn knew it was about to leak and she didn't pack any changes so she snatched Valentina's bag and went to the toilets to change. </p>
 
<p>Halfway through her phone buzzed. It was Valentina. </p>
 
<p>Valentina: y did u take my bag? -_-</p>
 
<p>Lyn: Sorry I had to change </p>
 
<p>Valentina: u didnt pack a change? </p>
 
<p>Lyn: I didn't think it would take this long and I didn't think I would drink this much Lmao.</p>
 
<p>Valentina: i need to change to lol</p>
 
<p>Lyn: Okay, I'm almost done. I'll slip your bag under the stall so no one thinks something is up. </p>
 
<p>Valentina: ok (=</p>
 
<p>Valentina went in and Lyn slipped the bag under the stall. Lyn had a used diaper and the bin was next to the sink so she peered over the door just to make sure no one was there. No one was so she quickly ran and threw it in the bin.</p>
 
<p>Someone came in so she pretended to wash her hands. She saw in the mirror who it was. It was Valentina's twin sister, Harmonia. </p>
 
<p>"Hi Lyn," She said.</p>
 
<p>"Oh, uh, hiya Harmonia,” Lyn Replied. </p>

<p>Lyn found it super awkward as Harmonia was The most popular girl in the school and hung out with all of the other popular, hot girls. Even more awkward is now she knew her secret about her being a bedwetter.</p>
 
<p>"Uh, how's your sister going?" Lyn asked. </p>
 
<p>"I don't see her… She's uhhhh... Different I guess…" Harmonia answered winking. </p>
 
<p>"Okay?" Lyn Replied a little confused. Harmonia walked into the stall and then Valentina quickly ducked out before Harmonia noticed her. They went out and their pizzas were ready. On the way out Valentina chugged about half a litre of cola for no reason and already wet herself again. </p>
 
<p>"It's so awkward being around your sister. How is she so popular?" Lyn asked. </p>
 
<p>"Because she's so hot, I mean she has had a boyfriend since before high school, I've been single my whole life and I'll probably be single forever, I have glasses, I'm an introvert, I have a flat chest and with this whole diaper thing.”</p>
 
<p>"There are ABDL dating sites.”</p>
 
<p>"There are also crazy murderers out there.” </p>
 
<p>"But they exaggerate cyber safety shit at school don't worry someday you'll have a boyfriend who'll love you and not care about your diaper thing.” </p>
 
<p>"I hope so but I'm not so optimistic. Hey Lyn, I think I might know a shortcut." </p>

<p>"I bet this will actually take longer.” </p>
 
<p>"No, I think it will be quicker, trust me it cuts through the park.”</p>
 
<p>"Oh, why didn't we go through there before?!" </p>
 
<p>"I dunno.” </p>
  
<p>As they walked through the park Valentina was starting to feel the cola she chugged before coming through. Her diaper had Leaked a little. Luckily no one was there to see it. </p>
 
<p>"Ok I need to change," Valentina said quickly. </p>
 
<p>"There are no toilets here Val, you'll just have to wait.”</p>
 
<p>"I know, uh, Sigh There's a bush over there. It's big, I can change in there you stand guard." </p>
 
<p>They walked over to the bush and Valentina couldn't stand up and change in there so she had to lie down, except she didn't know how to change herself while she was lying down. </p>
 
<p>"Hey, Lyn, Uh, this is gonna sound fucking weird but can you change me?" </p>
 
<p>"Uh, Why?" </p>
 
<p>"I can't get myself into the right position in this bush except lying down and I don't know how to change myself lying down."</p>
 
<p>"Oh fine." </p>
 
<p>Valentina lay down as Lyn changed her and then Lyn found herself with a dirty diaper and nowhere to put it.</p>
 
<p>"Where can I put it, Val?" </p>
 
<p>"There are no bins, are there? Actually this entire park is just trees and bushes; they have nothing here. Uh, just leave it here.”</p>
 
<p>"I can't because once we leave the bush and Someone's here they'll probably think we were doing drugs and check out the crime scene to find a diaper and if it's an adult we know like a parent or a teacher, it's going to be fucking awkward.”</p>
 
<p>"Ok, Uh, You're right. Well, I guess it rained last night so the ground is damp enough we can bury it?" </p>
 
<p>"Okay then."</p>
 
<p>The two girls spent five minutes using just their hands and a stick digging a hole. They finally buried it and made sure no one saw them walking out of a bush and then left. </p>
 
<p>"Not gonna Lie," Lyn said smiling "I kinda enjoyed that.”</p>
 
<p>"Enjoyed what?" Valentina asked, confused.</p>
 
<p>"Changing you.”</p>
 
<p>"Hmmm, yeah, me too. Okay. Can I try to change you then?" </p>
 
<p>"Okay, uh, I guess I haven't been changed by someone else since I was four, so why not?” </p>
 
<p>"Oh, my mum even changed me when I was fourteen.” </p>
 
<p>"Huh!?" </p>
 
<p>"My parents used to be super overprotective of me when I was in diapers. I only wet the bed until I was nine, I just spent five years pretending. Eventually, my parents bought a special sheet you can wet in and these weird potty training underwear so I had no need to wet the bed but I knew my parents would be suspicious and think I pretended so over the next two years I gradually stopped wetting the bed on purpose.</p>
 
<p>"Overprotective parents huh? Can't relate" </p>
 
<p>"My parents still treat me like a baby and not in a nice way. They give Harmonia sooooo much freedom." </p>
 
<p>The girls made it back To Valentina's house and opened up the TV to see if there was something to watch. They started going through Netflix and couldn't find anything to watch so they just went to Valentina's Bedroom and ate way too much pizza and drank too much cola.</p> 
  
<p>"Let's just go to sleep now Valentina," Lyn said.</p>
 
<p>"Ok, but Lyn can you change me again?" </p>
 
<p>"Only if you change me, Val." </p>
 
<p>The girls changed each other, double diapered themselves and drifted off to sleep. They couldn't wait to wake up the next day.</p>
